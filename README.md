## 🐾 How to Play

1. **Click on Animals**  
   Start by clicking on the animals to collect resources like eggs, milk, and wool.

2. **Unlock New Animals**
    - Each animal unlocks after you've collected enough resources from the previous ones.
    - For example, collect eggs from chickens to unlock cows, then milk from cows to unlock sheep, and so on.

3. **Advance Through Levels**
    - After unlocking all 11 animals up to the donkey, you'll have the option to move to the next level.
    - Each level increases the difficulty:
        - **More resources required** to unlock animals.
        - Animals begin to move across the screen from Level 2 onwards.
        - Every 5 levels, the animals' speed increases!

4. **Upgrades and Boosts**
    - Buy an **Auto-Collector** to collect resources automatically.
    - Activate **Double Output** for 30 seconds to collect resources faster.

5. **Challenge Yourself**  
   Progress through the levels, master the farm, and see how far you can go!
